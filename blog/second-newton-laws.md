# Newton's law of motion
## Second Newton's law of motion

> The change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed; and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed.

By "motion", Newton meant the quantity now called momentum, which depends upon the amount of matter contained in a body, the speed at which that body is moving, and the direction in which it is moving. In modern notation, the momentum of a body is the product of its mass and its velocity:

$$ p = mv $$
